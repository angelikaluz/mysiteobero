                        <h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>My name is Angelika Luz R. Obero. I was born in Marikina City and raised in Villasis, Pangasinan. 
                            I am 20 years old and my birthday is January 18, 2001. I am the youngest in the family and I have 
                            a brother and his name is John Benedict. My mother is Ma.Luz Obero and my father is Ben Obero.</p>

                        <p> I studied Grade School in Barangobong Elementary School and Junior High School at Barangobong National
                             High School. I am consistent honor student. I graduated in Grade School as First Honorable Mention 
                             and completed Junior High as second honor. I continued my Senior High School at Don Ramon E. Costales 
                             Memorial National High School taking up Technical Vocational Livelihood focus on Computer System Servicing. 
                             I graduated in Senior High as With High Honors and passed the National Certificate II in CSS. 
                             Now, I am Second Year College taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and currently 
                             studying in Pangasinan State University - Urdaneta City Campus.</p>

                        <p>
                            My hobbies are watching kdrama and anime. I also love dancing and singing even though I'm not good at it. 
                            I want to learn on how to ride a bicycle because I'm suck at it and learn how to play guitar. My inspiration 
                            in life is my family of course. I want to be successful to be able to provide them a better life. I also have 
                            inspirations which are my idols, Kathryn Bernardo and  the Filipino boyband, SB19. They inspire me a lot 
                            because they are so successful now. I want to be like them. I love their hardwork in their crafts especially SB19. 
                            For me, they are the most humble, hardworking and dedicated in their passion. They inpires me a lot because I, myself, 
                            sometimes doubting my ability. 
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                Now, I am a student of IT and I cherish the hope that my diploma will become my ticket to a better tomorrow. 
                                As of now my goal is to graduate college in perfect time. And I want to develop my skills and ability to get a 
                                better job in the future. 

                                The most important life values for me is "Don't compare your progress with others. 
                                We all need our own time to travel our own distance".
